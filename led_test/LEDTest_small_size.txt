This example exercises the LEDs
on LatticeMico32 Development board.

It scrolls a running pattern on the LEDs.

This template is similar to LEDTest, except,
it overrides LatticeDDInit implementation
and does not use printf and lookup services
to reduce code size.

-----------------------------------------
NOTE: This may not work on the ISS if the
      ISS is not modified to support GPIO
      instance.

 PREREQUISITES:
                                                                                                    
 - GPIO with 8-bit output named LED
   connected to the board's LED pins.

******************************************
This example will run on the Lattice 
Standard PCI Express Development board
using PlatformF & targeting a 
LFE2M35E-7F672CES device.
